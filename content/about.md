## This Blog 
This blog consists of articles about programming, philosopy, and more. From deep dives to well-rounded overviews that remove mysticism, everything is easily explained in a consumable way. Every article tries to take a new point of view, to link ideas together, and to tackle topics that haven't been before.

## The Author
I am Chirag Wadhwa, a deliberate person tackling the world as a system of interconnected ideas and concepts. I like programming, heavy metal, and long walks.
